This collection celebrates the invitations that iconic artist, Keith Haring, made for parties and events in NYC during the 1980s. From Party of Life, to events at the Paradise Garage, which was a muse for Keith's energetic work, we hope you enjoy these special designs.

Keith Haring

A key figure in New York's East Village scene in the late 1970s and 80s, American artist Keith Haring's artwork populated not only art galleries, but also the city's subways, streets, and sidewalks. His work often combined an iconographic vocabulary, including hearts, flying saucers, winged figures, and a crawling “radiant baby,” with abstract marks and patterning.

Color & Rhythm

Carmen Herrera, Lygia Pape, and Hélio Oiticica were at the forefront of modern art in Latin America, using geometric shapes and colors to bring their work to life with energy and beauty.
Hélio Oiticica

One of the most influential artists in the twentieth century, Hélio Oiticica pioneered new aesthetic experiences that blurred the boundaries between life and art. Oiticica challenged traditional notions of art by making viewer participation essential in his work. His dynamic grid-like compositions on cardboard, suspended wooden structures, wearable objects, and large-scale multisensorial installations, have influenced generations of contemporary artists worldwide.

Color & Rhythm

Carmen Herrera, Lygia Pape, and Hélio Oiticica were at the forefront of modern art in Latin America, using geometric shapes and colors to bring their work to life with energy and beauty.
About MoMA

The Museum of Modern Art in New York City is the world's home for modern and contemporary art. Founded in 1929, MoMA was the first museum dedicated to new art and this bold, experimental vision continues to guide us today. We share the most thought-provoking and resonant works, from painting to performance, and are a place of creativity and inspiration for all.
Lygia Pape

Lygia Pape was at the forefront of the Brazilian avant-garde, moving towards a unique reframing of geometry and abstraction working in a wide range of media including painting, drawing, poetry, graphic design, photography, film and performance. She was among the first to question the space between artwork and the viewer, creating works that demanded participation or interaction and marking a breakthrough moment in 20th-century art that continues to influence artists today.

VERDY is a graphic designer with VK DESIGN WORKS, involved with such projects as “Girls Don’t Cry” and “Wasted Youth.” He currently lives in Tokyo, where he is active mainly with street scenes. His work is attracting attention both in Japan and overseas.
VERDY commented, “Just when I was thinking that I wanted to share my graphics more broadly, I thought that UT would be a good way to introduce my work to a wide range of people who don’t know who I am, and agreed to the collaboration.” “The idea of ‘Break the Mold,’ or pursuing new challenges, is something that I feel all the time. In these and other graphics, I incorporate the messages that occur to me in everyday life.”

VERDY is a graphic designer with VK DESIGN WORKS, involved with such projects as “Girls Don’t Cry” and “Wasted Youth.” He currently lives in Tokyo, where he is active mainly with street scenes. His work is attracting attention both in Japan and overseas.
VERDY commented, “Just when I was thinking that I wanted to share my graphics more broadly, I thought that UT would be a good way to introduce my work to a wide range of people who don’t know who I am, and agreed to the collaboration.” “The idea of ‘Break the Mold,’ or pursuing new challenges, is something that I feel all the time. In these and other graphics, I incorporate the messages that occur to me in everyday life.”

A selection of Japanese color woodblock prints from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, made by ukiyo-e artists who flourished during the late Edo period.

Color & Rhythm

Carmen Herrera, Lygia Pape, and Hélio Oiticica were at the forefront of modern art in Latin America, using geometric shapes and colors to bring their work to life with energy and beauty.
About MoMA

The Museum of Modern Art in New York City is the world's home for modern and contemporary art. Founded in 1929, MoMA was the first museum dedicated to new art and this bold, experimental vision continues to guide us today. We share the most thought-provoking and resonant works, from painting to performance, and are a place of creativity and inspiration for all.
Carmen Herrera

Carmen Herrera (b. 1915, Havana Cuba) is a painter, sculptor, and master of crisp lines and contrasting chromatic planes. Herrera's lifetime of work has established, quietly but steadily, an important cross-cultural dialogue within the international history of modern abstraction.

Color & Rhythm

Carmen Herrera, Lygia Pape, and Hélio Oiticica were at the forefront of modern art in Latin America, using geometric shapes and colors to bring their work to life with energy and beauty.
About MoMA

The Museum of Modern Art in New York City is the world's home for modern and contemporary art. Founded in 1929, MoMA was the first museum dedicated to new art and this bold, experimental vision continues to guide us today. We share the most thought-provoking and resonant works, from painting to performance, and are a place of creativity and inspiration for all.
Hélio Oiticica

One of the most influential artists in the twentieth century, Hélio Oiticica pioneered new aesthetic experiences that blurred the boundaries between life and art. Oiticica challenged traditional notions of art by making viewer participation essential in his work. His dynamic grid-like compositions on cardboard, suspended wooden structures, wearable objects, and large-scale multisensorial installations, have influenced generations of contemporary artists worldwide.

RISE AGAIN BY VERDY

VERDY is a graphic designer with VK DESIGN WORKS, involved with such projects as “Girls Don’t Cry” and “Wasted Youth.” He currently lives in Tokyo, where he is active mainly with street scenes. His work is attracting attention both in Japan and overseas.
VERDY commented, “Just when I was thinking that I wanted to share my graphics more broadly, I thought that UT would be a good way to introduce my work to a wide range of people who don’t know who I am, and agreed to the collaboration.” “The idea of ‘Break the Mold,’ or pursuing new challenges, is something that I feel all the time. In these and other graphics, I incorporate the messages that occur to me in everyday life.”

Carmen Herrera, Lygia Pape, and Hélio Oiticica were at the forefront of modern art in Latin America, using geometric shapes and colors to bring their work to life with energy and beauty.
Hélio Oiticica

One of the most influential artists in the twentieth century, Hélio Oiticica pioneered new aesthetic experiences that blurred the boundaries between life and art. Oiticica challenged traditional notions of art by making viewer participation essential in his work. His dynamic grid-like compositions on cardboard, suspended wooden structures, wearable objects, and large-scale multisensorial installations, have influenced generations of contemporary artists worldwide.

RISE AGAIN BY VERDY

VERDY is a graphic designer with VK DESIGN WORKS, involved with such projects as “Girls Don’t Cry” and “Wasted Youth.” He currently lives in Tokyo, where he is active mainly with street scenes. His work is attracting attention both in Japan and overseas.
VERDY commented, “Just when I was thinking that I wanted to share my graphics more broadly, I thought that UT would be a good way to introduce my work to a wide range of people who don’t know who I am, and agreed to the collaboration.” “The idea of ‘Break the Mold,’ or pursuing new challenges, is something that I feel all the time. In these and other graphics, I incorporate the messages that occur to me in everyday life.”

Color & Rhythm

Carmen Herrera, Lygia Pape, and Hélio Oiticica were at the forefront of modern art in Latin America, using geometric shapes and colors to bring their work to life with energy and beauty.
About MoMA

The Museum of Modern Art in New York City is the world's home for modern and contemporary art. Founded in 1929, MoMA was the first museum dedicated to new art and this bold, experimental vision continues to guide us today. We share the most thought-provoking and resonant works, from painting to performance, and are a place of creativity and inspiration for all.
Hélio Oiticica

One of the most influential artists in the twentieth century, Hélio Oiticica pioneered new aesthetic experiences that blurred the boundaries between life and art. Oiticica challenged traditional notions of art by making viewer participation essential in his work. His dynamic grid-like compositions on cardboard, suspended wooden structures, wearable objects, and large-scale multisensorial installations, have influenced generations of contemporary artists worldwide.

EDO UKIYO-E

A selection of Japanese color woodblock prints from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, made by ukiyo-e artists who flourished during the late Edo period. From the 1860s on, these prints became popular among European artists and art collectors and so had a strong influence on Western visual culture as well.

Carmen Herrera, Lygia Pape, and Hélio Oiticica were at the forefront of modern art in Latin America, using geometric shapes and colors to bring their work to life with energy and beauty.
About MoMA

The Museum of Modern Art in New York City is the world's home for modern and contemporary art. Founded in 1929, MoMA was the first museum dedicated to new art and this bold, experimental vision continues to guide us today. We share the most thought-provoking and resonant works, from painting to performance, and are a place of creativity and inspiration for all.
Lygia Pape

Lygia Pape was at the forefront of the Brazilian avant-garde, moving towards a unique reframing of geometry and abstraction working in a wide range of media including painting, drawing, poetry, graphic design, photography, film and performance. She was among the first to question the space between artwork and the viewer, creating works that demanded participation or interaction and marking a breakthrough moment in 20th-century art that continues to influence artists today.

Carmen Herrera, Lygia Pape, and Hélio Oiticica were at the forefront of modern art in Latin America, using geometric shapes and colors to bring their work to life with energy and beauty.
About MoMA

The Museum of Modern Art in New York City is the world's home for modern and contemporary art. Founded in 1929, MoMA was the first museum dedicated to new art and this bold, experimental vision continues to guide us today. We share the most thought-provoking and resonant works, from painting to performance, and are a place of creativity and inspiration for all.
Hélio Oiticica

One of the most influential artists in the twentieth century, Hélio Oiticica pioneered new aesthetic experiences that blurred the boundaries between life and art. Oiticica challenged traditional notions of art by making viewer participation essential in his work. His dynamic grid-like compositions on cardboard, suspended wooden structures, wearable objects, and large-scale multisensorial installations, have influenced generations of contemporary artists worldwide.

Color & Rhythm

Carmen Herrera, Lygia Pape, and Hélio Oiticica were at the forefront of modern art in Latin America, using geometric shapes and colors to bring their work to life with energy and beauty.
About MoMA

The Museum of Modern Art in New York City is the world's home for modern and contemporary art. Founded in 1929, MoMA was the first museum dedicated to new art and this bold, experimental vision continues to guide us today. We share the most thought-provoking and resonant works, from painting to performance, and are a place of creativity and inspiration for all.
Lygia Pape

Lygia Pape was at the forefront of the Brazilian avant-garde, moving towards a unique reframing of geometry and abstraction working in a wide range of media including painting, drawing, poetry, graphic design, photography, film and performance. She was among the first to question the space between artwork and the viewer, creating works that demanded participation or interaction and marking a breakthrough moment in 20th-century art that continues to influence artists today.

Color & Rhythm

Carmen Herrera, Lygia Pape, and Hélio Oiticica were at the forefront of modern art in Latin America, using geometric shapes and colors to bring their work to life with energy and beauty.
About MoMA

The Museum of Modern Art in New York City is the world's home for modern and contemporary art. Founded in 1929, MoMA was the first museum dedicated to new art and this bold, experimental vision continues to guide us today. We share the most thought-provoking and resonant works, from painting to performance, and are a place of creativity and inspiration for all.
Carmen Herrera

Carmen Herrera (b. 1915, Havana Cuba) is a painter, sculptor, and master of crisp lines and contrasting chromatic planes. Herrera's lifetime of work has established, quietly but steadily, an important cross-cultural dialogue within the international history of modern abstraction.

Carmen Herrera, Lygia Pape, and Hélio Oiticica were at the forefront of modern art in Latin America, using geometric shapes and colors to bring their work to life with energy and beauty.
About MoMA

The Museum of Modern Art in New York City is the world's home for modern and contemporary art. Founded in 1929, MoMA was the first museum dedicated to new art and this bold, experimental vision continues to guide us today. We share the most thought-provoking and resonant works, from painting to performance, and are a place of creativity and inspiration for all.
Lygia Pape

Lygia Pape was at the forefront of the Brazilian avant-garde, moving towards a unique reframing of geometry and abstraction working in a wide range of media including painting, drawing, poetry, graphic design, photography, film and performance. She was among the first to question the space between artwork and the viewer, creating works that demanded participation or interaction and marking a breakthrough moment in 20th-century art that continues to influence artists today.

A selection of Japanese color woodblock prints from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, made by ukiyo-e artists who flourished during the late Edo period. From the 1860s on, these prints became popular among European artists and art collectors and so had a strong influence on Western visual culture as well.

RISE AGAIN BY VERDY

VERDY is a graphic designer with VK DESIGN WORKS, involved with such projects as “Girls Don’t Cry” and “Wasted Youth.” He currently lives in Tokyo, where he is active mainly with street scenes. His work is attracting attention both in Japan and overseas.
VERDY commented, “Just when I was thinking that I wanted to share my graphics more broadly, I thought that UT would be a good way to introduce my work to a wide range of people who don’t know who I am, and agreed to the collaboration.” “The idea of ‘Break the Mold,’ or pursuing new challenges, is something that I feel all the time. In these and other graphics, I incorporate the messages that occur to me in everyday life.”

VERDY is a graphic designer with VK DESIGN WORKS, involved with such projects as “Girls Don’t Cry” and “Wasted Youth.” He currently lives in Tokyo, where he is active mainly with street scenes. His work is attracting attention both in Japan and overseas.
VERDY commented, “Just when I was thinking that I wanted to share my graphics more broadly, I thought that UT would be a good way to introduce my work to a wide range of people who don’t know who I am, and agreed to the collaboration.” “The idea of ‘Break the Mold,’ or pursuing new challenges, is something that I feel all the time. In these and other graphics, I incorporate the messages that occur to me in everyday life.”

This collection celebrates the invitations that iconic artist, Keith Haring, made for parties and events in NYC during the 1980s. From Party of Life, to events at the Paradise Garage, which was a muse for Keith's energetic work, we hope you enjoy these special designs.

Keith Haring

A key figure in New York's East Village scene in the late 1970s and 80s, American artist Keith Haring's artwork populated not only art galleries, but also the city's subways, streets, and sidewalks. His work often combined an iconographic vocabulary, including hearts, flying saucers, winged figures, and a crawling “radiant baby,” with abstract marks and patterning.

This collection celebrates the invitations that iconic artist, Keith Haring, made for parties and events in NYC during the 1980s. From Party of Life, to events at the Paradise Garage, which was a muse for Keith's energetic work, we hope you enjoy these special designs.

Keith Haring

A key figure in New York's East Village scene in the late 1970s and 80s, American artist Keith Haring's artwork populated not only art galleries, but also the city's subways, streets, and sidewalks. His work often combined an iconographic vocabulary, including hearts, flying saucers, winged figures, and a crawling “radiant baby,” with abstract marks and patterning.

VERDY is a graphic designer with VK DESIGN WORKS, involved with such projects as “Girls Don’t Cry” and “Wasted Youth.” He currently lives in Tokyo, where he is active mainly with street scenes. His work is attracting attention both in Japan and overseas.
VERDY commented, “Just when I was thinking that I wanted to share my graphics more broadly, I thought that UT would be a good way to introduce my work to a wide range of people who don’t know who I am, and agreed to the collaboration.” “The idea of ‘Break the Mold,’ or pursuing new challenges, is something that I feel all the time. In these and other graphics, I incorporate the messages that occur to me in everyday life.”

VERDY is a graphic designer with VK DESIGN WORKS, involved with such projects as “Girls Don’t Cry” and “Wasted Youth.” He currently lives in Tokyo, where he is active mainly with street scenes. His work is attracting attention both in Japan and overseas.
VERDY commented, “Just when I was thinking that I wanted to share my graphics more broadly, I thought that UT would be a good way to introduce my work to a wide range of people who don’t know who I am, and agreed to the collaboration.” “The idea of ‘Break the Mold,’ or pursuing new challenges, is something that I feel all the time. In these and other graphics, I incorporate the messages that occur to me in everyday life.”

Carmen Herrera, Lygia Pape, and Hélio Oiticica were at the forefront of modern art in Latin America, using geometric shapes and colors to bring their work to life with energy and beauty.
Hélio Oiticica

One of the most influential artists in the twentieth century, Hélio Oiticica pioneered new aesthetic experiences that blurred the boundaries between life and art. Oiticica challenged traditional notions of art by making viewer participation essential in his work. His dynamic grid-like compositions on cardboard, suspended wooden structures, wearable objects, and large-scale multisensorial installations, have influenced generations of contemporary artists worldwide.

EDO UKIYO-E

A selection of Japanese color woodblock prints from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, made by ukiyo-e artists who flourished during the late Edo period. From the 1860s on, these prints became popular among European artists and art collectors and so had a strong influence on Western visual culture as well.

VERDY commented, “Just when I was thinking that I wanted to share my graphics more broadly, I thought that UT would be a good way to introduce my work to a wide range of people who don’t know who I am, and agreed to the collaboration.” “The idea of ‘Break the Mold,’ or pursuing new challenges, is something that I feel all the time. In these and other graphics, I incorporate the messages that occur to me in everyday life.”

Keith Haring

A key figure in New York's East Village scene in the late 1970s and 80s, American artist Keith Haring's artwork populated not only art galleries, but also the city's subways, streets, and sidewalks. His work often combined an iconographic vocabulary, including hearts, flying saucers, winged figures, and a crawling “radiant baby,” with abstract marks and patterning.

EDO UKIYO-E

A selection of Japanese color woodblock prints from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, made by ukiyo-e artists who flourished during the late Edo period. From the 1860s on, these prints became popular among European artists and art collectors and so had a strong influence on Western visual culture as well.
